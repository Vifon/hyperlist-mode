-*- hyperlist -*-

* The basic features of HyperLists (given here as a valid HyperList)
** Hyperlists contains Items (elements, usually on a single line)
*** An Item can have a child, adding description or depth to its parent Item
**** A child is an indented Item under its parent Item
*** A semicolon can be used instead of a line break to separate Items
** Bold text, italics or underlined text can be used wherever you want
*** Top level Items are in bold for clarity
** An Item can contain various elements, optionally color coded for clarity
** Square brackets indicate a condition or Qualifier for the Item - in green color
*** The Item is valid only when the condition described inside the brackets is met
*** A condition can be prefixed with a question mark to make it read ifâ€¦
*** A single question mark enclosed in square brackets ([?]) denotes an optional item
** A word in capitals ending in a colon is called an Operator - in blue color
*** An Operator operates on that item
*** If a line ends in an Operator, it operates on all the children of that Item
*** Some usual Operators:
**** "AND" - to indicate that all children applies or must be done
**** "OR" - to indicate that just one child applies or must be done
**** "EXAMPLES" - the following are examples
**** "CONTINUOUS" - something that is to be done throughout a process
** Words not in capitals and ending in a colon is a Tag - in red color
*** Tags add structured information to an Item
**** EXAMPLES: Deadline for the Item/task or who is responsible for completing it
*** If a line ends in a Tag, it applies to all the children of that Item
** Text inside angle brackets (< and >) indicates a Reference - in <purple> color
*** A Reference in a process means that you jump to where the Reference points
** You can use Twitter-type hashtags anywhere you like - in #yellow color
** Text in parenthesis or quotation marks are represented in teal color
